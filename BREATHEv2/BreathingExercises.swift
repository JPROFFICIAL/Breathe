It is sometimes compared to Counting Sheep", "howTo": "To start, inhale through your nose for a count of 4, and exhale through your nose for another count of 4. This will add natural resistance to your breath. Once mastered, you can aim for 6 to 8 counts per breath.", "inTime": "4.0", "outTime": "4.0", "holdTime": "0", "repeatNumber": "5"],

You can perform the 'Relaxing' or '4-7-8' breath anywhere, but while learning it is recommended you sit in an upright position with your back straight. Relaxing grows in power with repetition and practice so Breathe this atleast twice a day. DO NOT do more than four breaths at one time/cycle for the first month. ", "howTo": "Place the tip of your tounge against the tissue behind your front teeth and keep it there throughout the exercise. You will be exhaling from around your tounge. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a 'Whoosh' sound. Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose for a count of FOUR. Once there, hold your breath for a count of SEVEN, then exhale with a 'Whooshing' sound through your mouth for a count of EIGHT. That is one Breath.

For a more advanced version of this exercise, refer to the 'Roll'.", "howTo": "Place your left hand on your belly and your right hand on your chest. Take a deep, slow breath through the nose ensuring the diaphragm inflates and not your chest with enough air to stretch the lungs.

It is best done when you need to focus or energize yourself. Heads up! This can be a difficult exercise to do if you have a stuffy-nose.", "howTo": "In a comfortable/meditative position, hold your right thumb over the right nostril and breathe deeply through other. At the peak of inhalation, quickly close off the left nostril with your ring finger and exhale through the right. Continue the pattern by closing off left, inhaling through right, and exhaling out left.", "inTime": "4.0", "outTime": "4.0", "holdTime": "0", "repeatNumber": "4"],

If done correctly you should feel aware and full of energy as if you just completed a workout. You should feel the effects on the back of your neck, chest and abdomen.", "howTo": "Inhale and exhale through your nose rapidly, keeping your mouth closed and relaxed. Try for 3 in and 3 out cycles per second. Your breaths in and out should be as short as possible, and equal in duration. DO NOT try for more than 15 counts on your first time, and ALWAYS remember to stop and adapt the exercise if you feel light headed or start to hyperventilate. With all of the exercises, once comfortable feel free to increase your time by five seconds or so.", "inTime": "10.0", "outTime": "6", "holdTime": "0", "repeatNumber": "3"],

It is an adapted version of the Abdominal Breathing technique.", "howTo": "This exercise is best learned lying on your back with your knees bent. Remember to inhale through your nose, and exhale through your mouth with your shoulders relaxed. Place your left hand on your abdomen and your right hand on your chest. Inhale first into your lower lungs, and then continue inhaling into your upper chest. Exhale slowly through your mouth, making a quiet whooshing sound as your left hand falls, then your right hand. Practice this exercise for 3 to 5 minutes. The motion in your diaphragm and chest is comparable to a wave. If beginning to become light headed or hyperventilate, slow your breathing and stand up slowly.", "inTime": "6.0", "outTime": "6.0", "holdTime": "0", "repeatNumber": "6"]
